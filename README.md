### Hey!ðŸ‘‹

My name's Eugene! I'm currently a sophomore at Yale studying Statistics. I've taken a broad range of theoretical coursework in stats, math, and CS, and I'm especially interested in the theory and application of data science and machine learning in both the tech and quantitative finance worlds.

Right now, I've been mainly working on a project to scrape data on fighters and past fights in the UFC (historical stats + betting odds) in an effort to build several predictive models and develop a betting strategy.

I'll be joining [Castleton Commodities International](https://www.cci.com/) this summer as a Data Science / Machine Learning intern.

Outside of academics and career interests, I'm a big fan of Legos, MMA, and listening to music - see below for what I'm listening to!
