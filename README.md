### Hey!ðŸ‘‹

My name's Eugene! I'm currently a sophomore at Yale studying Statistics. I've taken a broad range of theoretical coursework in stats, math, and CS, and I'm especially interested in the theory and application of data science and machine learning.

Right now, I've been mainly working on a project to scrape data on fighters and past fights in the UFC in an effort to build well-calibrated models and develop a betting strategy.

I'll be joining [Castleton Commodities International](https://www.cci.com/), a prop trading firm in the energy commodities market, as a Data Science/ML intern this summer. Previously, I interned at a startup and a large insurance firm doing analytics work.

Outside of academics and career interests, I'm a big fan of Legos, MMA, and listening to music - like the song below!
